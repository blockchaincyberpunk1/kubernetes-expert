Objective: To understand the advantages of containerization.

Task: In this assignment, students are required to write a short essay or create a presentation explaining the benefits of containerization. They should discuss how containerization differs from traditional virtualization, its impact on application development and deployment, and why it has become popular in modern software development.

Instructions:

Step 1: Research (20 points)

Instruct students to conduct research on containerization technology, including Docker and Kubernetes, and gather information about its benefits. They should explore online resources, articles, and documentation to understand the advantages of containerization.
Step 2: Essay or Presentation (40 points)
