  - Familiarize yourself with Docker, including installing Docker, creating images, and running containers.

### Module 2: Kubernetes Basics

- **Introduction to Kubernetes**
  - Learn about Kubernetes and its role in orchestrating containerized applications.
- **Kubernetes Architecture**
  - Understand the key components of a Kubernetes cluster, including nodes, pods, services, and controllers.

### Module 3: Deploying Applications on Kubernetes

- **Creating and Managing Pods**
  - Explore how to create, manage, and deploy pods, which are the basic units in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Scaling and Load Balancing**
  - Study horizontal and vertical scaling, and how to implement load balancing for your applications.

### Module 4: Service Discovery and Networking

- **Services and Service Discovery**
  - Learn about Kubernetes services, how they enable communication between pods, and service discovery.
- **Network Policies and Ingress**
  - Understand network policies for securing communication between pods and use Ingress controllers for routing external traffic.

### Module 5: Configuration and Environment Management

- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**
  - Explore ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration data and sensitive information in your applications.
- **Environment Variables and Configurations**
  - Learn how to manage environment variables and configurations within containers.

### Module 6: Kubernetes Tools and Monitoring

- **Kubectl and Kubernetes CLI**
  - Master the kubectl command-line tool for interacting with your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Monitoring and Logging**
  - Study Kubernetes monitoring tools and practices for tracking the health and performance of your applications.

### Module 7: Advanced Kubernetes Topics

- **StatefulSets and Persistent Volumes**
  - Dive into stateful applications, persistent volumes, and how to manage stateful workloads on Kubernetes.
- **Operators and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**
  - Explore custom controllers using Operators and create Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to extend Kubernetes.

### Module 8: Deploying Real-World Applications

- **Deploying Multi-Tier Applications**
  - Build and deploy multi-tier applications using Kubernetes, incorporating frontend, backend, and database components.
- **CI/CD and Kubernetes**
  - Integrate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with Kubernetes for automated deployments.

### Module 9: Community Engagement and Continuous Learning

- **Participation in Kubernetes Community**
  - Engage with the Kubernetes community through forums, meetups, and contributing to open-source projects.
- **Staying Informed**
  - Stay updated with Kubernetes updates, best practices, and emerging trends through documentation, conferences, and blogs.

## Exercises and Projects

Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to apply what you've learned through hands-on exercises and projects, including:

- Creating and managing simple pods and services on a local Kubernetes cluster.
- Deploying a real-world application with frontend, backend, and database components on Kubernetes.
- Developing a CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of applications to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Repository Contents

Once complete, this repository will include:

- Code snippets demonstrating key concepts.
- Code templates to help you get started with your own Kubernetes projects.
- Sample applications and configurations to illustrate real-world usage of Kubernetes.

Stay tuned as we populate the repository with valuable resources to aid your learning experience.
