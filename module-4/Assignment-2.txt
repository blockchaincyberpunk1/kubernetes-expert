Service Discovery with DNS

Objective: To understand how DNS-based service discovery works in Kubernetes.

Task: Assign students a scenario where they need to set up service discovery using DNS within a Kubernetes cluster. They should deploy multiple pods, each providing a different service, and demonstrate how other pods can discover and communicate with these services using DNS.

Instructions:

Step 1: Initial Pod Deployment (15 points)

Provide students with a set of applications or microservices that are already containerized and ready for deployment as pods in a Kubernetes cluster. Ensure that each application runs as a separate pod.

Instruct students to deploy these pods in a Kubernetes cluster using the appropriate YAML manifests. Each application should have its own pod specification.

Step 2: DNS-Based Service Discovery (20 points)

Explain to students that in Kubernetes, DNS is used for service discovery. Pods can discover and communicate with other services using their service names as DNS addresses.

Assign students the task of deploying additional pods that need to communicate with the previously deployed applications. These new pods should demonstrate the use of DNS-based service discovery.

For example, if there is an application A with the service name "app-a-service," students should deploy a new pod that communicates with "app-a-service" using DNS. They should provide YAML manifests for these new pods.

Step 3: Testing and Verification (20 points)

Ask students to demonstrate that the newly deployed pods can indeed communicate with the existing services using DNS-based service discovery. They should test connectivity and show that DNS resolution is functioning correctly.
Step 4: Documentation (15 points)

Students should provide documentation that includes the following:
YAML manifests for the new pods demonstrating DNS-based service discovery.
A description of how DNS-based service discovery works in Kubernetes.
Test results showing successful communication between pods using DNS.
Step 5: Discussion (30 points)

Organize a class discussion or presentation where students share their findings and experiences. They should explain the importance of DNS-based service discovery in Kubernetes and discuss any challenges they encountered during the assignment.
Grading Criteria:

Correct deployment of initial pods and new pods.

Successful demonstration of DNS-based service discovery between pods.

Comprehensive documentation explaining the concept and showing test results.

Active participation in the discussion or presentation.
