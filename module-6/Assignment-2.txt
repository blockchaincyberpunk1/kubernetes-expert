Deploying Monitoring Tools

Objective: To learn how to set up monitoring and logging tools in Kubernetes.

Task: Ask students to deploy monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Fluentd to a Kubernetes cluster. They should configure these tools to collect and visualize metrics and logs from a sample application. Students should provide screenshots of dashboards and explain the key metrics they are monitoring.

Instructions:

Step 1: Tool Selection (5 points)

Provide students with a list of monitoring and logging tools commonly used in Kubernetes, such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Fluentd.

Instruct them to choose at least one monitoring tool and one logging tool from the list.

Step 2: Cluster Setup (10 points)

Guide students in setting up a Kubernetes cluster if they don't already have one. They can use Minikube, kind, or a cloud-based Kubernetes service like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
Step 3: Deploy Sample Application (15 points)

Provide students with a simple sample application or container image. This can be a web application, microservice, or any application they choose.

Instruct them to deploy the sample application onto their Kubernetes cluster.

Step 4: Tool Deployment and Configuration (30 points)

Students should deploy the monitoring and logging tools they selected onto their Kubernetes cluster.

They should configure the tools to collect metrics and logs from the sample application.

In the case of Prometheus and Grafana, they should set up dashboards and alerts for monitoring.

Step 5: Metric Monitoring (20 points)

Students should use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor key metrics from their sample application.

They should provide screenshots of the Grafana dashboards and explain the significance of the monitored metrics.

Step 6: Log Collection (10 points)

Using Fluentd or a similar tool, students should collect and store logs from their sample application.

They should demonstrate how to access and search the logs.

Step 7: Documentation and Explanation (10 points)

Instruct students to document the entire process, including tool selection, deployment, configuration, metric monitoring, and log collection.

They should explain why the selected metrics and logs are essential for monitoring an application.

Step 8: Submission (10 points)

Require students to compile their documentation and screenshots into a report or document.

They should submit the report along with any necessary configuration files or scripts used in the process.

Grading Criteria:

Successful deployment and configuration of monitoring and logging tools.

Clear documentation of the setup process, including screenshots.

Comprehensive explanations of the selected metrics and logs.

Submission of both the report and configuration files.
